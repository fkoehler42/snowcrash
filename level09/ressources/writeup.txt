- List the files in level09 user home directory to find 'level09' executable and 'token' file owned by flag09 user (setuid control bit active on the executable).

- 'token' file is readable by level09 user so we can print its content.

`cat token`
f4kmm6p|=�p�n��DB�Du{��

- This string contains some out of ascii bounds characters and does not work to log in flag09 nor level10 user.

- Use ltrace with the executable to find the following hint : "You should not reverse this".

`ltrace ./level09`
__libc_start_main(0x80487ce, 1, 0xbffff804, 0x8048aa0, 0x8048b10 <unfinished ...>
ptrace(0, 0, 1, 0, 0xb7e2fe38)                                                                = -1
puts("You should not reverse this"You should not reverse this
)                                                           = 28
+++ exited (status 1) +++

- Run the executable with differents arguments to understand how it works.

`./level09`
You need to provied only one arg.
`./level09 toto`
tpvr
`./level09 aaaaaaaa`
abcdefgh

- The executable seems to encrypt the string passed as argument by adding to each character its own index.

- Write a program which takes the encrypted string as argument and subtract to each character the value of its index.

`cd /tmp`
`vi decrypt.c` (file attached)
`gcc -std=c99 decrypt.c -o decrypt`
`./decrypt `cat ~/token``

`su flag09`
